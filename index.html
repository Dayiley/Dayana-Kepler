                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Dayana (dah-YAH-nah) it rymths with "Banana"
                        Born and raised in Cuba, I carry the resilience, and warmth of my island everywhere I go. Now, I'm proud to be planting roots in Alabama, doing my best to turn a new place into home. I am an Industrial Engineer with five years of experience in data analysis, I've always had a passion for numbers, but creativity has been my constant companion too. That's what drew me to software development—it's the perfect intersection of logic and imagination. </p>
                        <p>I am currently enrolled in classes through Code the Dream, giving my best to complete the Front-End Path and grow my skills in modern web technologies. By day (and often weekends!), I am also a part-time pet sitter—because nothing balances debugging better than dog energy. In my earlier professional life, I worked in administrative roles in the Cuban tourism industry, where I supported business operations, streamlined workflows, and coordinated travel logistics with a strong focus on service and precision.</p>
                        <p>In my spare time, you'll find me juggling life with my boyfriend and our two pups—equal parts love and lovable chaos. To stay grounded, I turn to yoga, and I'm always up for trying new hobbies or picking up a fresh skill. I also enjoy painting, sketching, and exploring different creative mediums.
